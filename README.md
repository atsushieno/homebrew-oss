# homebrew-oss

This repository hosts Homebrew formulas for atsushieno projects. Add the tap:

```bash
brew tap atsushieno/oss https://github.com/atsushieno/homebrew-oss
```

Then install any provided formula, e.g.:

```bash
brew install atsushieno/oss/uapmd
```

Once tapped, you can also install directly:

```bash
brew install uapmd
```

Each formula pulls from the corresponding upstream source; update the files when you cut new releases.
